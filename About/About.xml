  <description>A number of basic shelves and crates for storing items. When building general-purpose shelving please remember to enable the items you want to store.
  Also includes a nesting box for eggs. It will hold both fertilized and unfertilized eggs, with a default of fetilized at critical importance. If you place it next to a table people might even sit on the eggs.</description>
